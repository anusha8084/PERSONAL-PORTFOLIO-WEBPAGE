# PERSONAL-PORTFOLIO-

*COMPANY* : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: ANUSHA ADDYOLA

*INTERN ID* : CT04DL81

*DOMAIN* : FRONT END DEVELOPMENT

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH

*DESCRIPTION* : 
As part of my front-end development learning journey, I created a professional and visually appealing developer portfolio using only HTML and CSS. This portfolio is designed as a single-page layout, ensuring that all the essential content like my name, role, project highlights, technical skills, and contact information is visible without the need for scrolling. This structure not only enhances the visual experience but also makes the entire page ideal for presentations, screenshots, or print formats.

The portfolio was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the primary code editor. The entire structure is hand-coded without the use of frameworks or external libraries, demonstrating my understanding of raw HTML and CSS. I used Flexbox for layout management and CSS gradients to create an appealing background that transitions smoothly across vibrant colors, giving the site a modern and dynamic look.

Tools & Technologies Used:
HTML5: For building the structure and semantic layout of the page.

CSS3: For styling, layout design, responsive formatting, and visual effects.

VS Code: For writing and managing the code efficiently.

Browser (Chrome/Edge): For testing and previewing the design in real time.

The design includes a clean and minimalist header with my name and role. Below the header, it presents a summary of my top three completed projects. These include a quiz app, a real-time chat application, and a front-end UI for an e-learning platform. Rather than using long descriptions, each project is briefly explained with key features to give a quick but clear idea of my work. These projects represent my understanding of different front-end concepts, interactivity, and user experience design.

Following the projects, the skills section outlines the various technologies I’m familiar with, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Git & GitHub, and WebSockets. These skills are displayed in a tag-style format to make the section compact yet visually structured. This section is particularly important because it gives a quick glance at the tools I’m capable of using in development projects.

To complete the portfolio, a contact section is provided. It includes essential links like Email, GitHub, and LinkedIn, making it easy for viewers, recruiters, or collaborators to connect with me. The line “You can reach out to me via…” is smartly placed in the same view, so everything fits perfectly within a single screen without scrolling.

The decision to build everything into a single-page format was intentional. It makes the portfolio clean, direct, and professional. This design approach is also practical when showcasing work during interviews, online submissions, or portfolio reviews where space and clarity matter.

In summary, this portfolio is a representation of my foundational skills in front-end development, especially my ability to create structured, responsive, and elegant designs using just HTML and CSS. It emphasizes my ability to work independently, pay attention to UI/UX, and effectively communicate technical work through clean design. The combination of practical project experience, focused skill presentation, and a stylish visual theme makes this portfolio both functional and professional.
